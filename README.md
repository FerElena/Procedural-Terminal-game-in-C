# Procedural-Terminal-game-in-C
Small procedural game in the Linux Terminal , programmed in C

The aim of this project was to make a procedural puzzle game, so that each level is different from the previous one, and has an ingenious approach. All levels are different from the previous one (unless the seed is the same, whose probability is 1 in 2³²) and the difficulty of the levels increases as you progress through them. 

The aim of the game is to progress through the levels. To do this, in each level a number of random rectangles will appear, which have 4 corners, and if you shoot at one of these corners, it will bounce off at a 90º angle. The objective is to hit all the rectangles with a single shot, if the player hits all the rectangles, he will pass to the next level, otherwise he will lose a life.

The main character can shoot in 6 directions: left-right, down-left, down-right, up-right, up-left and up-right. To exit the game simply press enter at any time. 

Keep progressing on levels top reach new levels of dificulty, who knows, maybe you could reach a level so high that the game brokes (something like tetris).
